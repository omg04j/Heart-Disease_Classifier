# Heart Disease Classification Project
üìã Overview
This project implements multiple machine learning models to predict the presence of heart disease based on various medical attributes. After comparing different algorithms, Logistic Regression emerged as the best performing model. The project aims to assist medical professionals in early detection and risk assessment of heart disease.

üéØ Features
Binary classification of heart disease presence (1 = yes, 0 = no)
Comparison of multiple classification algorithms:
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Random Forest
Logistic Regression
Data preprocessing and feature engineering
Model performance comparison
Performance metrics visualization
üîß Technologies Used
Python 3.x
Libraries:
scikit-learn (for KNN, Random Forest, and Logistic Regression)
pandas (for data manipulation)
numpy (for numerical operations)
matplotlib (for visualization)
seaborn (for enhanced visualizations)
üìä Dataset
The project uses the Cleveland Heart Disease dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

Data Sources
Original dataset: UCI Machine Learning Repository
Alternative source: Kaggle
Data Dictionary
age - Age in years
sex - Gender (1 = male; 0 = female)
cp - Chest pain type
0: Typical angina (heart-related chest pain)
1: Atypical angina (non-heart-related chest pain)
2: Non-anginal pain (typically esophageal spasms)
3: Asymptomatic (no signs of disease)
trestbps - Resting blood pressure in mm Hg (>130-140 indicates concern)
chol - Serum cholesterol in mg/dl
Calculated as: LDL + HDL + 0.2 * triglycerides
Values >200 indicate concern
fbs - Fasting blood sugar >120 mg/dl (1 = true; 0 = false)
126 mg/dL signals diabetes

restecg - Resting electrocardiographic results
0: Normal
1: ST-T Wave abnormality (from mild to severe)
2: Probable/definite left ventricular hypertrophy
thalach - Maximum heart rate achieved
exang - Exercise-induced angina (1 = yes; 0 = no)
oldpeak - ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest
slope - Peak exercise ST segment slope
0: Upsloping (better heart rate with exercise, uncommon)
1: Flatsloping (minimal change, typical healthy heart)
2: Downsloping (signs of unhealthy heart)
ca - Number of major vessels colored by fluoroscopy (0-3)
thal - Thallium stress test result
1,3: Normal
6: Fixed defect (previous defect, now ok)
7: Reversible defect (improper blood flow during exercise)
target - Heart disease presence (1 = yes, 0 = no)
Model Performance and Evaluation
Performed hyperparameter tuning using:
RandomizedSearchCV for initial parameter space exploration
GridSearchCV for fine-tuning
k-fold (k=5) cross-validation for robust evaluation
